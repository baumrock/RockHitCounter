# RockHitCounter

ProcessWire module that extends PageHitCounter to show historical page hit statistics.

Note that the external resources (tabulator and plotly) are at the moment simply loaded from CDN. Feel free to improve that. But the important think is to STORE data in the custom table. The presentation layer of this module will evolve after time.
